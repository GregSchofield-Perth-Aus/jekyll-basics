## Updating egg

If you need to upgrade egg, just remove the `_sass/vendors` folder and run `bower install`.

## Run

It's a regular jekyll site:

    jekyll serve

If you're running it locally, you'll need to overload the configuration with the development specific variables (it's also a good idea to use the `--incremental` flag):

    jekyll serve --config _config.yml,_config-dev.yml --incremental
